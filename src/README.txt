How to run:
The main method is in the Table class. You can run the code from there!

Description:
This is meant to mimic a producer-consumer problem using multithreading. An agent randomly picks 2 different
ingredients from the 3 options available and sets it on the table, then chefs with an infinite amount of 1
of each ingredient take turns trying to cook. The chef only cooks if it has all 3 ingredient it needs to make
the sushi.

SIDE NOTE:
The code will produce the correct output but the program itself will not end until you manually end it.
Enjoy!
